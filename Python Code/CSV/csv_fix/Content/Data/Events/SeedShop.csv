"...But, I guess you have a point. If I make all my customers angry, then pretty soon I won't have any customers at all..."	"……不過你說得也有道理。如果我惹惱了所有顧客，那很快就沒有人來買東西了……"	"963113/n pierreQualityCrops"
"Your veggies look great, @. It's Pierre's price that turned us away."	"@，你的蔬菜賣相很好。是皮耶爾出的價格把我們趕跑了。"	"963113/n pierreQualityCrops"
